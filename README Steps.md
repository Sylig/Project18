REACT LOCAL STATE MANAGEMENT AND EVENTS

Steps

- Create an interest calculator web page with React and JSX with the following content:

- Create a folder on your local machine.

- Open the command-line interface/terminal and cd to the folder you have created above.

- Follow the instructions found here to install React using the Create React App (CRA) Starter Kit.

- Once you have started your front-end server (with npm start), test the default React App that was created by CRA by navigating to
http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

- Create a website that will simulate a banking application with the following functionality:

1. The app should display the user’s current bank balance.
2. The app must have an input for the user to deposit money to the bank (the user should input a number and click a button that will add the “deposit” amount to the currently displayed bank balance).
3. The app must have an input for the user to withdraw money from the bank (the user should input a number and click a button that will remove the withdrawn amount to the currently displayed bank balance).
4. There should be a button that the user can click to “add interest” to the account, using either a fixed interest rate percentage or a rate the user has entered in another input, that will then be added to the balance being displayed.
5. There should be a button that the user can click to “Charge bank fees”, that can be either a fixed amount or calculated as a percentage of the bank balance, that is then deducted from the displayed balance.
6. This app must use at least two separate components with a shared state that is lifted to a parent component.

For the reader: Remember to run "npm start" on your terminal.
